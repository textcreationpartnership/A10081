            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of this Theologicall vertue of the <hi>Feare of God,</hi> that thoſe who have leaſt affinitie with it, yet applaud it, and profeſſe it: And it is my happineſſe, that nothing can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a grace, that is not with advantage ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centred in this. If I ſhould here declare the nobilitie, excellencie, and tranſcendencie of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14046:8"/>the feare of God in it ſelfe; and the utilitie, and abſolute indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable neceſſitie of it in reference to us, I ſhould but fore-ſtall and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my ſelfe. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficient to premiſe, both to excuſe my writing, &amp; to provoke all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians adviſedly, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and throughly to read this enſuing diſcourſe: that, though many have briefe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayes, yet few, or none, have done this Royall grace the honour, or right to allot unto it a compleat full treatiſe. And that that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite alleyes &amp; minds
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14046:8"/>hither, is this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other graces are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly pertinent to perſons, as they are members of a family in the threefold combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation therin; between husband and wife, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and childe, maſter and ſervant. Or as they are members of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke body, eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall or civill. And when other duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſpecification and reſtriction from cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of time &amp; place, this of the <hi>feare of God,</hi> like a well lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed picture, caſteth an eye on all that looke
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14046:9"/>on it. It correſponds to all perſons, none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. It is ſeaſonable at all times, ſacred and common; eſpecially when the ſcourges of God lye upon neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, and threaten us. And the thoughts hereof may juſtly in all places, preſſe upon us, without being guilty of unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly inſtruction.</p>
            <p>Now, for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall contriving of this diſcourſe, I ſhall (by divine aſſiſtance) purſue that order that may moſt aptly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and may bee moſt

               <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the nature and kindes both of feare in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and of the feare of God in particular.</head>
            <p>THE firſt inquiry will be, <hi>What the feare of God is.</hi> Where the nature and kindes both of feare in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and in particular of the feare of God, will opportunely fall in.</p>
            <p>Now to penetrate the depth of this <hi>Quaere,</hi> we muſt diſtinguiſh of feare.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:14046:10"/>
            <p n="1">1. As it is a naturall affection indifferent in it ſelfe; neither moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, nor evill.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As it is a habit or qualitie inherent in the affection.</p>
            <p>If we conſider feare as it is a naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction implanted in the reaſonable Soule of man, indifferent in it ſelfe, neither morally good nor evill: Then</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of feare.</note>For the generall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, it</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either ſtands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe, at ſome diſtance from its object, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and reverencing it: Or</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is averſe from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14046:10"/>its object. For affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are of two ſorts, Either ſuch as cleave unto, and deſire a neere union with their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as faith, love, and hope: or ſuch as turne from, and deſire a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſeparation from their object, as hatred, and ſome kinde of feare.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2 The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of feare.</note>2. If we looke into the ſubject, wherein this affection of feare is implanted, it will bee found to reſide,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the ſenſitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: for there is a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall appetite, and that is the will that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually followes the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14046:11"/>the guidance of the underſtanding. And there is an inferior ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive appetite, which containes within its verge, the paſſions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which oft runne afore the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and the will; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more raſh, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and head-ſtrong; and one of theſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions is feare.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a double facultie in the ſenſitive appetite; namely, the concupiſcible facultie which lookes on the object under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good or evill. To which head the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14046:11"/>of love, joy, and griefe are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>The other is called the <hi>Iraſcible</hi> facultie, which lookes on the object under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of difficultie; to which head are to bee reduced, hope, which lookes on a good hard to bee obtained; and feare that lookes on ſome evill, hard to bee avoyded. This is the ſubject wherein feare dwels.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3. The object of feare</note>3. For the object of feare, it is</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sometimes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good, which we eſteem, &amp; feare to loſe.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:14046:12"/>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes it is ſomething that is great and potent, which we feare to offend.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sometimes it is ſomething full of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, excellencie, and glory, which wee feare with a reverential feare, with a feare of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sometimes it is ſomething evill: that is, either that which is evill in it ſelfe; in its owne nature, or that which ſeemes to us to be evill; or that which may prove perniicous &amp; prejudiciall unto us.</p>
            <p>And the evill which we feare is,</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:14046:12"/>
            <p n="1">1. Future, to come, wee are troubled for thoſe things that may come to paſſe.<note place="margin">Math. 24.6.</note> If an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill be preſent, we feele it, we hate it, we grieve under it: if it bee to come, we feare it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the obiect of feare is the futurity of evill: ſo alſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquitie and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie of it. We feare that evill moſt, that hangs over our heads, ready to ſeize us: that like a maſtive lies at the doore,<note place="margin">Gen. 4 7.</note> waiting but the opening thereof, that he might flye in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Therefore to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright men from envie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14046:13"/>and malice, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſayth, that
<hi>the Iudge ſtands afore the doores.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iames
5.9.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The obiect of feare is as the neareneſſe, ſo the unavoy dableneſſe, the unreſiſtableneſſe of evill; evill, that like the travaile of a woman,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 5.3</note> cannot be eſcaped.</p>
            <p>Wee ſee what the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of feare is.</p>
            <p>Next, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider feare as it is a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, or qualitie inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the affection. And ſo feare is either morall or ſpirituall.<note place="margin">Morall feate.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Morall feare, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therthat vertue that is oppoſite to audaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where by we feare
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14046:13"/>and ſhun thoſe things that are contradictory to the principles of morall vertue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſied reaſon. Or elſe it is taken for that feare that wee call <hi>Puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> that is contrary to fortitude or magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity: when a man is ſo timorous, that as
<hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeakes of the ſluggard, he cries when hee is put upon any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that <hi>there is a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the way:</hi> When a man feares more the ſhew and ſhadow of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, than the evill it ſelfe; as children feare more the vizor, than the man: when a man
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14046:14"/>feares that leaſt, that he ſhould feare moſt; and that moſt, that hee ſhould feare leaſt. As our brainleſſe Duellers feare more the loſſe of reputation, when it may be they never had any, than they feare the loſſe of their ſoules. And therefore wiſe-men know ſuch ſingle combatants to bee the groſſeſt cowards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they in ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, feare a croſſe word, or the giving of the
<hi>lye.</hi> And cowards are moſt cruel, for they will bee ſure to kill, if they can, leſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſurviving them,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14046:14"/>ſhould after be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon them. This is morall feare.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Spirituall feare.</note> 2. What ſpirituall feare is, wee ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by two or three profitable diſtinctions, which doe reflect one upon another; and con tribute mutuall light each to other, and all of them doe illuſtrate the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The firſt diſtinction.</note>The firſt diſtinction is, that ſpirituall feare is five-fold. 1. The feare of a guiltie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. 2. The feare of a ſeave. 3. The feare of a ſervant.
4. The feare of a ſon. 5. The feare of a chaſte and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14046:15"/>a loving Wife.</p>
            <p>There is a ſpirituall feare proceeding from a ſelfe-accuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that is like the feare of a Felon, either ready to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or ſtanding at the barre afore his Iudge: when a man onely feares GOD as his Iudge, or as his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. And this feare is ioyned with a hatred of God, and with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret wiſh, that there were no God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us. And this feare is lively and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically expreſt in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture. It was in <hi>Adam</hi> after his defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14046:15"/>He hid him for feare among the Trees of the Garden.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.8.</note> It was in <hi>Cain</hi> after hee had made his brother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bel</hi> the firſt Martyr, and himſelf the firſt mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 4.14.</note> ſayth hee, <hi>that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man that meets me, ſhall ſtay me.</hi> His guilty feare preſented him with troopes of men, when there were none almoſt beſides himſelfe in the world; and with a thouſand deaths, when he could dye but once.<note place="margin">Levit. 26.36. Pro. 28.1.</note> 
               <hi>The ſound of an Aſpen leafe ſhall chaſe the diſobedient.<note place="margin">Geen. 20 4.</note> The wicked flies when no

20.4.</note> They are a terrour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, afraid of their owne ſhadowes. This guilty feare the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then uſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to
<hi>Siſyphus</hi> his reſtleſſe rolling of the ſtone, and to

The ſaints on earth are partly fleſh, and partly ſpirit: new converts are more fleſh, leſſe ſpirit. Ancient ſtanders in the ſchoole of Grace, are more ſpirit, leſſe fleſh.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14046:40"/>In all the faithfull there is a combate betweene the fleſh and the ſpirit.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.17.</note> The fleſh and the ſpirit are contrary to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that we cannot doe the things that we would. The ſpirit is willing, but the fleſh is weake. A Chriſtian betweene theſe two, is like a peece of iron be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two load-ſtones, the one drawes one way, and the other the other way; like a horſe under an unskilfull ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſpurres him on, and reines him in Sometimes the ſpirit hath the better of the fleſh; ſometimes the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14046:41"/>fleſh hath the upper hand of the ſpirit: ſometimes the carnall feare of man prevailes againſt the filiall feare of GOD. When the Saints are thus ſhaken and winnowed by the reliques of ſin in them, and by the temptation of Sathan, they are not hereby proved to bee chaffe, though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that they are not without chaffe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As this feare of men in good men, is not ſeparated from the true feare of God: ſo neither from the true love of God. When S.
<hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt,

               <note place="margin">Iam. 4.4.</note> But hee that ſometimes over-feares the world, may yet both dearly love, and ſincerely feare God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When hee that feares God doth thus over-feare man; hee doth it not with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted ſwing of his affection; but
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14046:42"/>hee reſiſts this carnall feare, and heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that it were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expelled; and that the feare of God in him were perfect, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed. <hi>Thy ſervants deſire to feare thy name,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nehem. 1.11.</note> ſayth <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> The feare of man in them is a tyrant, that forces their ſubjection, not their King, to whom they freely yeeld their homage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the filiall fearers of God doe fall thus through the feare of men, they fall not upon premeditation, but ſuddenly, beeing ſurprized by temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14046:42"/>unawares. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell takes them at an unexpected advantage. The ſtorme comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have leaſure to ſnatch their cloake about them. As a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant man may ſtartle at the ſudden diſcharge of a peece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance behind his back; who otherwiſe having time to collect &amp; ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon his ſpirits, would not feare to ſtand at the mouth of a charged Canon in a good cauſe. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by the damoſell ſuddenly, before hee could have reſpite to reach to his weapon of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14046:43"/>faith to draw it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as had hee had never ſo little time to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected himſelfe, his <hi>tongue</hi> wold never have ſo groſly tranſgreſſed its bounds.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Though a childe of God be thus for the preſent ſcared by man, yet let him alone a while, and hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to his true tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he will recover his guard againe, and his ſpirituall will conquer his carnall feare. As if you ſhake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, the Needle may bee turned from the North; but let the Compaſſe ſtand ſtill a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14046:43"/>while, and then the Needle will poynt full toward the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarre. The moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pilote may in a ſtorme, be forced from his intended ſcope, and port, who when the windes are ſilenced, wil ſteere a right courſe again. Put oyle &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a glaſſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; ſhake the glaſſe, the water it may bee, may get uppermoſt, but let the glaſſe ſtand a while, and the oyle will, like a triumphant liquor, recover the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminence. Though Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the time of temptation, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14046:44"/>his maſter, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, when hee came to himſelfe, hee wept bitterly for it: and after that hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſt ſtoutly a fore a Councell, who before denied him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Damoſell: and he ſealed his profeſſion with his blood.
<hi>Ecebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who in <hi>Iulians</hi> time, revolted from the truth for the feare of man, did afterward caſt himſelfe downe in the ſight of all, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hearing of all, <hi>Kick me unſavory ſalt.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of thoſe ſignes that put a difference betweene the ſlaviſh, and the filiall feare of God.</head>
            <p>THE ſlaviſh, and theſ on-like kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feare of God, differ</p>
            <p n="1">1. In their ſeverall grounds and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſlaviſh feare is awaked onely by threatnings denounced by God againſt diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. This moved King <hi>Abimelech</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore <hi>Sara</hi> to <hi>Abraham;</hi> God in a dreame ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14046:61"/>to him, that if hee reſtored her not,<note place="margin">Gen. 20.7 8.</note> hee and all his ſhould dye for it. When
<hi>Ionas</hi> had cryed,<note place="margin">Ionas 3.4.5.</note> 
               <hi>Fourty dayes and Niniveh ſhould bee destroyed:</hi> then they were amazed, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and prayed. On the otherſide, the filiall feare of God will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked by the meere commandment of <hi>God,</hi> though there were no commination annexed thereunto. This <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> calles,<note place="margin">Pro. 13.13</note> 
               <hi>fearing the commandement;</hi> that is, fearing not to do what is commanded, meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and fearing to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14046:62"/>doe what is forbidden, becauſe it is forbidden, though the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were not backed, nor ſeconded with any ſanction either of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or threatning.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſlaviſh feare is ſtirred up onely by judgements inflicted on mens ſelves, or on others. <hi>Thou O God,</hi> (ſayth
<hi>Aſaph</hi>) <hi>didſt cauſe judgement to bee heard from heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 76.8.</note> 
               <hi>then the earth feared:</hi> whereas filiall feare is excited by the mercy, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſſe of God. <hi>There is mercy with thee that thou mayeſt bee feared.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 130.4.</note>
               <note place="margin">Hoſea 3.5</note> 
               <hi>They ſhall feare
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14046:62"/>the Lord and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> ſayth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <hi>God will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict</hi> (ſayth <hi>Iob</hi>)
<hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe men feare him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iob. 37.23.24</note> What men? Certainly not ſlaves, but loving and loyall ſonnes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Slaviſh, and filiall feare differ in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The object of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh feare is not ſinne, but puniſhment. As children feare a Cole onely when it burnes; but otherwiſe be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo blacke, they will delight to handle it. Thus <hi>Balaam</hi> did not feare to curſe Gods people, but hee feared
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14046:63"/>the Angell that met him in the way with a drawne ſword.<note place="margin">Numb. 22.31.32</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the object of fi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liall feare is ſin, though there were no plagues in ſtore here, nor no hell hereafter for the offender. <hi>A righteous man feares an oath,</hi> ſayth <hi>Salomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.2</note> That is, he doth ſo much feare the curſe of the flying booke that ſhall enter into the houſe of the ſwearer, as he feares the oath it ſelfe. He feares more to ſweare, than that God ſhold ſweare in his wrath againſt him.<note place="margin">Pſal. 95.11</note> Hee more feares to curſe then to be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14046:63"/>To hate than to be hated: to injure than to be injured. Hee feares more active, than paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive evill. Like that woman in the Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicke, that having a fire-brand in one hand, and a pot of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the other, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, wiſhing that with that fire-brand ſhee could dry up the waters of Paradiſe; and with that water quench the flames of hell, that ſhee might ſerve God, neither for hopes of heaven, nor for feare of hell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the object of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh feare be ſinne; yet
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14046:64"/>it is onely ſinne of the groſſer ſize, of a ſcarlet dye.<note place="margin">Mat. 23.24.</note> As the Phariſees feared to ſwallow Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, but gnats would downe well enough. And among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, many feare the more horrid oathes; but the leſſer breake no ſquares with them. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feare to kill a man, who feare not to ſpleen, hate, back-bite, or curſe him, which is murder in a degree, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour reckons it in his Sermon on the mount.<note place="margin">Mat
5.21.22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, they that filially feafe God, feare thoſe ſinnes that ſeeme leaſt, as idle
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14046:64"/>words, &amp; vain thoghts. <hi>David</hi> feared the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.4.5. Iob. 31.1.</note> 
               <hi>Iob</hi> feared to look upon a mayd luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſtealing of a few apples.
<hi>Iohn Hus</hi> feared leſt hee ſhould ſpend too much time at Cheſſe-play. The truely fearfull are jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous over themſelves in the uſe of indifferences, leſt in taſting of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, they ſhould like a flye, ſticke in the ſlime.</p>
            <p>Let every man apply this triall to himſelfe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Slaviſh and filiall feare differ in their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14046:65"/>conſequents, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Slaviſh feare dulles and deadens a mans heart, ſo that hee is fit for no good thing. It made <hi>Nabal</hi> his heart dye within him;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.37.</note> ſo that hee became as a ſtone. When God (ſayth <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>) rebuked, and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the wicked, <hi>they fell into a feare, ſo that none of them found their hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 76.5.6.8.</note> 
               <hi>but they were caſt into a dead ſleepe.</hi> As when there was an earth-quake at Chriſt his riſing, and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels countenance was as lightning,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.4.</note> the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers for feare ſhooke,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14046:65"/>and became as dead men.</p>
            <p>But filiall feare makes ſuch as are indued with it lively, and active in their duty. Thus <hi>Noah</hi> being <hi>moved with feare,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note> did not ſit ſtill, <hi>but prepared an Arke.</hi> And indeed this is Gods command. <hi>What</hi> (ſayth
<hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>doth the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but to feare him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut.
10.12.</note> 
               <hi>&amp; to walk in his wayes?</hi> Filiall feare makes not a man lame in his duty, but ſets him upon his legges.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If ſlaviſh feare move a man to doe any good, it will be but juſt ſo much as the fearer
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14046:66"/>thinkes will ſerve him, and no more. He will give God but gold-weight; very hard meaſure. But filial feare will make a man to ſtrive after perfection, to preſſe hard forward to the mark of the high calling. And therefore Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons runs thus.
<hi>Perfect holineſſe in the feare of God.</hi>
